# clock-math
Finds arithmetically meaningful arrangements in clock-formatted sets of numbers, e.g. 5:14 : 5 + 1 = 4.

This is undoubtedly the dumbest thing I have ever coded.  I, like some other people, look for meaningful mathematical 
arrangements when I glance at a clock, and I wanted to know the chance that any random time is meaningful.
It turns out, for 12-hour time, it's 65.14%, for 24-hour time, it's 67.82, and for some 4-digit decimal number, it's 64.27.
